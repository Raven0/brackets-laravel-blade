Laravel Blade
=============
Syntax highlighting for [*Brackets code editor*](http://brackets.io/).

##Supports:

* Comments: **{{-- --}}**
* Laravel 4: **{{  }}**
* Laravel 5: **{%  %}**

###**Current State**
Currently this extension supports only basic syntax, I plan to add support for the full Laravel Blade template system.
At this moment it does not support line breaks, I'm still trying to figure how to do that....

***Note:*** *I only have basic .js knowledge (let alone Code Mirror...), so any help you can provide will be greatly apreciatted.*
